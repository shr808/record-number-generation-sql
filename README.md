# Record Number Generation (SQL)

This example demonstrates a common database pattern used in form-based
and workflow-driven systems.

## Description
Returns an existing record number if a record already exists.
Otherwise, generates the next sequential record number.

## Use Cases
- Preventing duplicate records
- Idempotent form submissions
- Internal workflow systems

## Notes
This is a simplified, vendor-neutral example derived from
real-world enterprise systems.
